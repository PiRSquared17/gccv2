Description of the proprietary binary format of `*.gcc` files.


=GCC file format:=

There is one header with 26 bytes
and then any number of records each with 10 bytes
(except waypoints which have additional 2 bytes for each character of the name)

==Header (26 bytes):==
 * 3 characters: "GCC"
 * 1 byte: version number currently 1 (binary)
 * 6 bytes: start time in format: year-2000, month, day, hour, minute, second
 * 8 bytes double: reference latitude (start point y)
 * 8 bytes double: reference longitude (start point x)

==normal Records (5 short ints):==
 * x in m from reference point
 * y in m from reference point
 * z in m from sea level
 * s speed in 0.1 km/h
 * t time in seconds from start (unsigned short int)

==special Records:==

*origin shift (0):*
 * (x) x shift in m
 * (y) y shift in m
 * (z) 0 (origin shift)
 * (s) -1 (special record)
 * (t) 0xFFFF (special record)


*battery (1):*
 * (x) battery in %
 * (y)
 * (z) 1 (battery)
 * (s) -1 (special record)
 * (t) 0xFFFF (special record)


*GPS option (2):*
 * (x) gps_poll_sec
 * (y)
 * (z) 2 (gps option)
 * (s) -1 (special record)
 * (t) 0xFFFF (special record)


*waypoint (3):*
 * (x) number of characters
 * (y)
 * (z) 3 (waypoint)
 * (s) -1 (special record)
 * (t) 0xFFFF (special record)
 * waypoint name (each character encoded as 2-bytes)


*heart rate (4):*
 * (x) heart rate in bpm
 * (y)
 * (z) 4 (heart rate)
 * (s) -1 (special record)
 * (t) 0xFFFF (special record)
